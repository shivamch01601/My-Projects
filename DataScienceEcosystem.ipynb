    "### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Python's Built-in `eval` function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   expression = \"3 + 5 * 2\"\n",
    "   result = eval(expression)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 13\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `eval` function can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions from strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using the `sympy` Library (Symbolic Mathematics):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sympy import *\n",
    "\n",
    "   x = symbols('x')\n",
    "   expression = 3 * x + 2\n",
    "   result = expression.subs(x, 5)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 17\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `sympy` library allows you to work with symbolic mathematics, making it suitable for more complex expressions and symbolic manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the `numpy` Library (Numeric Computing):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "   expression = \"3 * sin(0.5)\"\n",
    "   result = eval(expression, {\"sin\": np.sin})\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 1.4999999999999998\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can use `numpy` to evaluate mathematical functions within expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Third-party Libraries like `numexpr`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numexpr as ne\n",
    "\n",
    "   expression = \"3 * (a + b)\"\n",
    "   a, b = 2, 4\n",
    "   result = ne.evaluate(expression)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 18\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `numexpr` library is designed for fast numerical expression evaluation, especially for large arrays of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Manual Parsing (Basic):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def evaluate_expression(expression):\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           return eval(expression)\n",
    "       except Exception as e:\n",
    "           return str(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "   expression = \"3 + 5 * 2\"\n",
    "   result = evaluate_expression(expression)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 13\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, we define a custom function that uses `eval` and handles exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using the `eval` Function with a Dictionary (for safety):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   expression = \"3 + 5 * 2\"\n",
    "   allowed_functions = {\"__builtins__\": None}\n",
    "   result = eval(expression, allowed_functions)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 13\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   To enhance security when using `eval`, you can restrict the available functions and variables by passing a dictionary to it.\n"
